# Documentation Generation Rules for SQWease

## Project Info
- Name: SQWease (Speak Quite Well with Ease)
- Status: EARLY DEVELOPMENT (~5% COMPLETE)
- Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, CSV data format
- Last Updated: January 2025

## Context Files Cursor Will Reference
- project_specs.md — Project vision and features
- ROADMAP.md — Feature roadmap (Now/Next/Later)
- ARCHITECTURE.md — System design (generate from README prompt)
- memory-bank/ — Project context for AI and maintainers: activeContext.md, progress.md, color-alignment-theory.md. Read at start of tasks when working on Boxes, coloring, or tokenization.

## Known issues (for AI and maintainers)
- **Boxes coloring (resolved Feb 2026):** All boxes coloring rules now live in dedicated `boxes-coloring.js`. Do not add boxes-specific rules to romaji.js (grammatical particles only) or syllable-color.js (generic behavior). See memory-bank/color-alignment-theory.md for current architecture.

## Documentation Standards
- Use markdown format
- Include complete, runnable code examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Target audience: Developers new to this project
- Link between related docs

## AI Disclosure Pattern
When generating docs, mark AI-assisted sections:
- "Initial structure generated by Cursor AI, reviewed manually"
- // AI-scaffolded: [Description]

## Validation Checklist
Before finalizing any doc:
- [ ] Test all code examples
- [ ] Verify endpoints/features actually exist
- [ ] Check all links work
- [ ] Read for accuracy against actual codebase
